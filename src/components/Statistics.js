       <ol>
<li> The global average carbon footprint is about 4 tons per person with the highest in the United States (16 tons). </li>
<li>One-fourth of the earthâ€™s species are likely to face extinction within the next 40 years if climate change continues to increase at the current rate. </li>
<li>Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions can help prevent up to 3 million premature deaths yearly by the year 2100.</li>
<li>If each of the 140 million homes in a city replaces its incandescent light bolb with an energy-efficient CFL lamp, it can save enough energy to power over 3 million homes in a year.</li>

            This is a graph showing how carbon emission have rapidly increasing
            in past years
            <br />
            The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is 16
            tons, one of the highest rates in the world. Globally, the average
            carbon footprint is closer to 4 tons. To have the best chance of
            avoiding a 2â„ƒ rise in global temperatures, the average global carbon
            footprint per year needs to drop to under 2 tons by 2050.
